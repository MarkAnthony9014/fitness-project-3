# LiftoSphere

## Project
    As a team of full stack web developers we want to establish a social
    platform based on health and fitness. Here, users will be able to 
    communicate with another, make friends, and share their thoughts.

## Descrption
    In order to have the application perform as intended, 
    we constructed the code base as following:

    * Used GraphQL for api configuration such as: 

        * The enability to set a category for a post
        * Creating posts
        * View user/other profiles
        * Add friends
        * Sign up/Log out/Log in

    * Deployed the application to Heroku using Mongoose

    * By using the create-app function from React, we established 
    a base to work off from for the application and added our 
    own dependencies:

        *concurrently   nodemon
        apollo/client   web-vitals
        testing-library/jest-dom
        testing-library/react
        testing-library/user-event
        graphql   jwt-decode
        react   react-dom
        react-router-dom
        react-scripts
        

        
    * In the client side package Json, we downgraded the react 
    dependencies to enable the ability for out app to be abke 
    to run on the port we initiate

## Built With
    * JavaScript
    * Node.js
    * GraphQl
    * React
    * Apollo Server
    * Mongoose
    * Express.js
    * NoSql/MySQL

## Installation

    into their terminal: npm i
